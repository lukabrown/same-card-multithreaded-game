# thread-synchronous-game

Game by Luka Brown

The program will create two outputs. One output.txt which records every single game action,
and then a terminal output that just displays the final hands and who won each round. The
actual output does not display which suit it is, but the terminal output does.


Instructions:

WINDOWS:
compile using the command similar to 'g++ game.cpp -o game'
LINUX:
compile using the command similar to 'g++ game.cpp -o game -lpthread'

Run with only 1 integer parameter: the starting seed value
